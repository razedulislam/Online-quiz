# Online-quiz
Using JS dom manipulation I have created this online quiz web app. When a student will participate in this online quiz, he will see the count-down or he will get fixed time to complete the quiz. If the student can not complete the quiz in this period, the session will be expired and will be able to see the mark score.

Features:
1. Student can see the time progess
2. Able to see mark score
3. Can try again for the quiz

Here I have implemented DOM manipulation, count-down, html,css and js.
